Auxiliary notes from Dan's lecture on acquiring EMG Data

Grading:
	Algorithm goes in the BMI code
	Walk up to you, Chris and Dan walk up. Flex relax flex relax flex relax.
	3 Cycles of flex/relax to see if it works.
	Chris will mark bord with a soldering iron.
	Put the code on a USB sitck and turn it in right away
	See if we used list comprehension

	List comprehension and for loops?

	For loop can be converted into list comprehension

Algorithms:
	Hint on the actual code:
	RMS values for data

	Detection algorithm:
		Analyzing a signal and want to detect an event within the signal.
		Realtime for us
		Usually there is noise that has to be filtered out.

	Good Algorithm:
		High sensitivity
			How often am i detecting an event?
			Flexing:
				Always detecting so you never miss a flex
				100% Sensitivity is worthless because of noise
				Detecting positives
		High specificity
			How often do I not detect a non-event.
			Never says you're flexing when you're actually not.
			Avoid false negatives.
			Detecting negatives

		Response Time:
			Realtime algorithm
			You want to detect the event immediately to actuate based on an event.

	How do we make a detection algorithm:
		2 major "knobs" we'll be twisting
			Threshold
				Pick a threshold that we compare the outputs of the algorithm to to determine whether or not we are flexing.



			Window
				How many data points am I looking at to make a decision.
				Should probably be fairly small so we don't get a non-responsive delayed algorithm.

				*****Your delay is at least as long as your window.

				Comparing a number we got out of the window to actuate > Threshold

			Window kicks out data and we compare it to a threshold.
