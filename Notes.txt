List Comprehension:
	Constructing lists in a "natural easy way like mathematicians do"
	Mathematical construction of a list

	Examples:
		S = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
		V = [2**i for i in range(13))]
		M = [x for x in S if x % 2 == 0]
		
	How this could be used to replace a for loop:
		new_things = []
		for ITEM in old_things:
			if condition_based_on(ITEM):
				new_things.append("something with " + ITEM)

		new_things = ["something with " + ITEM for ITEM in old_things if condition_based_on(ITME)]
