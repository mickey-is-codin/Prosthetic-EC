List Comprehension:
	Constructing lists in a "natural easy way like mathematicians do"
	Mathematical construction of a list

	Examples:
		S = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
		V = [2**i for i in range(13))]
		M = [x for x in S if x % 2 == 0]
		
	How this could be used to replace a for loop:
		new_things = []
		for ITEM in old_things:
			if condition_based_on(ITEM):
				new_things.append("something with " + ITEM)

		new_things = ["something with " + ITEM for ITEM in old_things if condition_based_on(ITEM)]

Data Listener:
	Event definition: "In computing, an event is an action or occurrence recognized by software, often originating asynchronously from the external environment, that may be handled by the software."

	Normally a loop is created to handle events. This is in the form of an update or a continuously refreshing function that asks for data or events.

Object-Oriented Programming:
	Delegate Event Model:
		A CONTROL which is the source of an event. For our purposes this would be the person hooked up to the EMG/the muscle.
		A LISTENER which interprets events from the control. Can be called an EVENT HANDLER. 
		An INTERFACE which delegates tasks based on the events that are interpreted by the listener.

		Requirements:
			every listener must implement the interface for the event it wants to listen to
			every listener must register with the source to declare its desire to listen to the event
			every time the source generates the event, it communicates it to the registered listeners, following the protocol of the interface.
